My name is Naama Kipperman, and I'm a second year Master of Public Health candidate in the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. 

You can learn more about my academic and professional experiences [here](aboutme.html).

If you want to see what kinds of shenanigans I get up to when I'm not doing data science, you can see my [personal gallery here](gallery.html).
